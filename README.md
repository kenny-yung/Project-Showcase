# Project Showcase
Welcome!
This repository serves to showcase my skills and software development experience.
Thank you for taking your time to discover what I can contribute!

## 📘 Master Thesis
This folder contains the work involved in my master thesis from RWTH-Aachen Simulation Science M.S. program.
The title is "Prognosis of Battery Health from Historical Aging Data", and it seeks to find the optimal ML regression method to predict battery health based on operational data.

## 📊 Accure work
This folder contains data analytic work from my time at Accure GmbH. They include samples of codes in Jupyter Notebook format analyzing insights of battery operational data and identify areas of concern.

## 🎓 Coursework
This folder designation represents academic projects done within my masters coursework. They include practical coding exercises done in areas of machine learning, computer vision, data science, and parallel computing.

## 📇 Project
This folder designation represents academic and personal projects that I worked on. _Parallelization of Finite Element_ is a project for solving the heat equation using PDE in C. The process is parallelized using supercomputer cluster by implementing OpenMP and MPI.
